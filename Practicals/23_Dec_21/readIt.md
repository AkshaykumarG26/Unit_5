------------------- this doc for react_intro_new -------------------

 to create new project use below cmd
 => create-react-app projectName
 and after that to run the react app 
 => npm start  ------> this can be seen in package.json file

 edit the app.js file in src folder to see the changes 
 open app.js delete the entire header part of the code  

 while editing to get the html suggetions just rename the app.js as app.jsx 

 always give the key value pair to style the page just like shown in the app.jsx file

 in app.jsx if u want to create ur own custom function then always give first letter capital otherwise it wont work
